# GeminiAPI_byGoogle_Udacity
This repository contains my work from the **"Gemini API by Google"** course, a free offering from Udacity. The course introduces concepts related to Large Language Models (LLMs), prompting, and building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow using the Apollo 11 dataset from NASA's archives.

## Course Overview

The course covers the following topics:
* **Introduction to Large Language Models (LLMs)**
* **Prompting Techniques**
* **Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Workflow**

## Jupyter Notebooks

The repository includes six Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate various aspects of the Gemini API:

1. **Prompting with Gemini API**
   * Demonstrates how the Gemini API accepts different types of inputs, including text, image, video, and audio.

2. **Gemini General Parameters**
   * Shows how to adjust various parameters like temperature, max output length, and token counting for generating responses.

3. **Gemini Function Calling**
   * Illustrates how the Gemini API can read and access functions to create responses for prompts. It also covers chat history and the handling of multiple function calls with different configurations.

4. **Gemini API Safety**
   * Explores how the Gemini API responds to safety restrictions and how to configure safety settings. It includes references for handling safety matters.

5. **Gemini API Embeddings**
   * Demonstrates how the Gemini API generates embeddings for data retrieval from various data types, useful in document search, anomaly detection, and text classification.

6. **Gemini Final Exercise**
   * A comprehensive project using the Gemini API's functionality and a vector database to build a full end-to-end multimodal RAG system. This system can handle text, video, and audio data to retrieve and summarize the extensive dataset from the Apollo 11 Mission in NASA's public archives.
